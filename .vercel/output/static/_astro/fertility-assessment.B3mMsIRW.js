<p>In about 20% of infertility cases, ovulation problems are found to be a primary cause. Ovulation issues, such as anovulation (when a woman does not ovulate), are a major barrier to conception.

<p>Through careful monitoring of the ovulation cycle, healthcare providers can detect any irregularities and create a targeted plan to improve fertility.</p>
<h3 id="tests-to-assess-ovulation">Tests to Assess Ovulation</h3>
<p>During an ovulatory function evaluation, various tests may be performed to gain an accurate understanding of the menstrual cycle, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basal Body Temperature (BBT):</strong> Monitoring body temperature to detect ovulation timing.</li>
<li><strong>Endometrial Biopsy:</strong> Examining the lining of the uterus to check for conditions that may prevent implantation.</li>
<li><strong>Serum Progesterone Test:</strong> Measuring progesterone levels to ensure the uterus is prepared for implantation.</li>
<li><strong>Hormone Testing:</strong> Analyzing hormone levels (like prolactin and thyroid hormones) that could impact ovulation.</li>

<h3 id="imaging-techniques-for-fertility-diagnosis">Imaging Techniques for Fertility Diagnosis</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transvaginal Ultrasound:</strong> A noninvasive way to examine the uterus and detect growths like fibroids or polyps that may interfere with fertility.</li>
<li><strong>Hysterosalpingogram (HSG):</strong> An X-ray procedure using contrast dye to check for blockages in the fallopian tubes or abnormalities in the uterus.</li>
<li><strong>Hysterosonogram (HSN):</strong> A saline infusion technique that helps identify issues within the uterus without using radiation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These procedures are key in understanding any structural issues and guiding treatment options that will enhance the chances of conception.</p>
<h2 id="fertility-hormone-testing-ensuring-hormonal-balance">Fertility Hormone Testing: Ensuring Hormonal Balance</h2>
<p>Hormonal imbalances can be a significant factor in infertility. Specialists typically conduct simple blood tests to evaluate hormone levels and their effects on fertility. Some of the critical hormones tested include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH):</strong> Determines egg supply in women or testicular function in men.</li>
<li><strong>Estradiol:</strong> A form of estrogen that influences ovarian function and egg quality.</li>
<li><strong>Luteinizing Hormone (LH):</strong> Assesses ovulation and sperm production.</li>
<li><strong>Progesterone:</strong> Prepares the uterine lining for pregnancy and ensures proper ovulation.</li>
<li><strong>Prolactin and Testosterone:</strong> Both impact sexual and reproductive health in men and women.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evaluating these hormones provides a comprehensive view of fertility status and helps design effective treatment plans.</p>

<p>Male fertility plays an equally important role in conception, and semen analysis is one of the simplest tests to detect issues. This test examines various factors of the semen sample, such as:</p>
