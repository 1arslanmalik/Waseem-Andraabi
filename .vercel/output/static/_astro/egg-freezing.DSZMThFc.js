<p>Egg freezing, or oocyte cryopreservation, is a state-of-the-art procedure that allows individuals to preserve their fertility by storing eggs for future use. This technique has gained prominence due to its ability to enable women and couples to delay parenthood while protecting their reproductive options. Here’s an overview of the egg freezing procedure, its success rates in Noida, and the associated costs.</p>

<p>The process of egg freezing involves several key stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ovarian Stimulation</strong>: The first step involves hormone injections to stimulate the ovaries, prompting them to produce multiple eggs. This stage typically lasts 10-12 days and requires regular monitoring through blood tests and ultrasounds to track egg development.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Egg Retrieval</strong>: Once the eggs are mature, a minor surgical procedure called egg retrieval is performed. Under light anesthesia, a thin needle is inserted into the ovaries to aspirate the eggs. This procedure usually takes 20-30 minutes and is minimally invasive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vitrification</strong>: After retrieval, the eggs are immediately frozen using vitrification, a rapid cooling technique that prevents ice crystal formation and preserves the eggs’ quality. These frozen eggs can be stored indefinitely until needed.</p>
