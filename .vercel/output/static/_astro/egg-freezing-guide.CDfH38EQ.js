Freezing your eggs before undergoing cancer treatment can be a lifeline to preserving your dream of having children with your own eggs.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss everything you need to know about the egg-freezing procedure, the associated costs, and finding the right IVF doctor in Delhi.</p>
<h2 id="why-consider-egg-freezing-before-cancer-treatment">Why Consider Egg Freezing Before Cancer Treatment?</h2>
<p>Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and ovarian surgery can significantly affect your fertility. These treatments can damage your ovaries and diminish your egg reserve, sometimes leading to premature menopause. By opting for egg freezing before starting your cancer treatment, you can preserve your eggs at their current quality and quantity. This proactive step provides you with the possibility of having biological children in the future, even if your fertility is compromised by the treatment.</p>

<h3 id="chemotherapy-and-radiotherapy">Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy</h3>
<p>Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be particularly harsh on the ovaries. These treatments can lead to a significant reduction in the number of eggs and can even cause premature menopause.

<p>Thanks to advances in cancer treatment, many patients now enjoy longer, healthier lives post-treatment. Once a woman has achieved cancer-free survival, she may wish to realize her dreams of becoming a mother or having her own genetic child.

<h3 id="initial-consultation-and-assessment">Initial Consultation and Assessment</h3>
<p>The first step in the egg-freezing process is consulting with a fertility specialist or an IVF doctor in Delhi. The doctor will assess your overall health, ovarian reserve, medical history, and future fertility goals. Blood tests and an ultrasound will be conducted to evaluate your hormone levels and the health of your ovaries.</p>
<h3 id="hormonal-stimulation-and-egg-development">Hormonal Stimulation and Egg Development</h3>
<p>Over a period of approximately two weeks, you will receive hormone injections to stimulate your ovaries to produce multiple eggs. This process can begin at any point in your cycle, not just on the second day as usually done. The progress of your egg development will be closely monitored through blood tests and ultrasounds.</p>
<h3 id="egg-retrieval">Egg Retrieval</h3>
<p>When your eggs have matured, a minor surgical procedure called egg retrieval is performed. Under sedation, a fine needle is used to extract the eggs from your ovaries. The procedure is typically quick, lasting about 15-20 minutes, and you can usually go home the same day.</p>
<h3 id="freezing-and-storage">Freezing and Storage</h3>
<p>After retrieval, the eggs are evaluated, and the mature ones are frozen using a process called vitrification. Vitrification is a rapid freezing technique that prevents the formation of ice crystals, which can damage the eggs. These frozen eggs are then stored in a specialized facility until you are ready to use them.</p>
<h2 id="timing-of-egg-freezing-procedure-in-cancer-treatment">Timing of Egg Freezing Procedure in Cancer Treatment</h2>
<p>For breast cancer patients, an ideal time for egg freezing is between breast surgery and the start of chemotherapy, typically a 4-6 week window. This timing ensures that the eggs are retrieved before exposure to chemotherapy, preserving their health and quality. However, even if you have already started chemotherapy, it is still beneficial to consider egg freezing as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="modified-hormonal-protocols">Modified Hormonal Protocols</h3>
<p>Hormonal injections are used for ovarian stimulation, but the protocols are modified for breast cancer patients. Combining hormonal injections with specific tablets keeps estrogen levels low, preventing any flare-up of breast cancer.</p>

<p>Once you are given the “all-clear” signal by your oncologist, usually 3-5 years after cancer treatment, you can try for a natural pregnancy.
