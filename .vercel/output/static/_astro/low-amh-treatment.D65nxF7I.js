<p>Low AMH (Anti-Mullerian Hormone) is a crucial marker in evaluating a woman’s ovarian reserve, which reflects the quantity and quality of her eggs. Produced by small follicles in the ovaries, AMH levels are typically measured through a blood test. Low AMH levels can indicate a reduced number of eggs or diminished ovarian function, presenting challenges for women trying to conceive.</p>

<p>Diagnosing low AMH involves a blood test that measures the concentration of AMH in the bloodstream. Lower AMH levels generally suggest decreased ovarian reserve. Results are usually reported in ng/ml or pmol/l, with reference ranges provided by laboratories and fertility specialists.</p>

<p>Several treatment options are available to address low AMH levels and support fertility:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ovulation Stimulation</strong>: Fertility medications such as Clomiphene citrate or Letrozole are used to stimulate follicle growth and increase ovulation chances. This approach may be combined with intrauterine insemination (IUI) to enhance pregnancy likelihood.</p>
