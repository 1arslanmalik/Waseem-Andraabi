<p>Laparoscopic surgery, also known as minimally invasive or keyhole surgery, is a modern technique used to diagnose and treat various abdominal and pelvic conditions. This approach is preferred for its minimally invasive nature, which results in smaller incisions, reduced pain, shorter recovery times, and a lower risk of infection compared to traditional open surgery.</p>
