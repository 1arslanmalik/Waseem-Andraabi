<p>Laser Assisted Hatching (LAH) is a technique used in IVF treatments to enhance embryo implantation, especially when the zona pellucida, the protective layer around the embryo, is unusually thick or rigid. By creating a precise opening in the zona pellucida, LAH facilitates the embryo’s ability to hatch and implant into the uterine lining.</p>

<p>The LAH procedure is performed at a critical stage during IVF, just before the embryo transfer. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Embryo Selection</strong>: High-quality embryos are selected for the procedure. These embryos are cultured in an incubator and closely monitored for optimal development.</p>
