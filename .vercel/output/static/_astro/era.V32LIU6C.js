<p><strong>Gene Expression Analysis</strong>:
The collected tissue sample is processed to isolate RNA (ribonucleic acid), which carries genetic information.

**Endometrial Receptivity Analysis (ERA)** is a diagnostic procedure used to evaluate the receptivity of the endometrium, or the inner lining of the uterus, to embryo implantation. This test is particularly valuable for cases of recurrent implantation failure (RIF), where embryos do not implant successfully despite multiple attempts. The ERA test identifies the most suitable window of implantation to ensure embryo transfer occurs at the optimal time for a successful pregnancy.

## ERA Test Procedure

The ERA test involves several key steps:

**Endometrial Biopsy**:
A minimally invasive biopsy is performed during the natural menstrual cycle or a hormone replacement cycle.
A small catheter is inserted through the cervix to collect a tissue sample from the endometrial lining.
This sample is used to analyze gene expression patterns related to the window of implantation.

**Gene Expression Analysis**: 
The collected tissue sample is processed to isolate RNA (ribonucleic acid), which carries genetic information.
The RNA is analyzed to assess the expression levels of key implantation-related genes.
These profiles provide insights into the endometrial receptivity status.

**Customized Timing Analysis**:
The gene expression data is compared to a reference database of known implantation windows.
By matching the patient's gene expression profile with this database, the ERA test determines the optimal time for embryo transfer.
This customized timing analysis enhances the chances of successful implantation.

## Success Rate of ERA Test

The success rate of the ERA test varies based on factors such as the specific fertility issues being addressed, the expertise of the medical team, and the accuracy of timing recommendations. Key factors influencing success include:

- **Patient-Specific Factors**: The underlying cause of recurrent implantation failure can impact success rates. Additional fertility factors, like male infertility or embryo quality, may also play a role.
  
- **Medical Expertise**: The skill of the healthcare provider in conducting and interpreting the ERA test is crucial. Centers with experienced reproductive endocrinologists and embryologists generally achieve better outcomes.
  
- **Customization**: Accurate customization of embryo transfer timing based on the ERA test results can lead to improved implantation rates.

By ensuring the timing of embryo transfer aligns with the optimal window of receptivity, the ERA test helps increase the chances of a successful pregnancy.
