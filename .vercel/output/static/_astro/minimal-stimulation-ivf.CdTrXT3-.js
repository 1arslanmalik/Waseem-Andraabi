**Minimal Stimulation IVF** (MS-IVF), also known as Mini-IVF or Micro IVF, is an assisted reproductive technology (ART) designed to help couples struggling with infertility. This procedure is a variation of traditional in vitro fertilization (IVF) with a focus on using fewer medications and a more streamlined approach.

## IVF vs. Mini IVF

### Stimulation Protocol
The key difference between traditional IVF and Mini-IVF lies in the stimulation protocol. Traditional IVF involves intensive hormone stimulation to produce a high number of eggs, often through daily injections of gonadotropins. In contrast, Mini-IVF uses lower doses of medication or oral medications to stimulate the ovaries, resulting in fewer eggs. This gentler approach helps to reduce discomfort and side effects while minimizing the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).

### Medications
Mini-IVF employs less aggressive medications compared to traditional IVF. Instead of injectable gonadotropins, Mini-IVF often involves oral medications such as clomiphene citrate or letrozole, which stimulate egg development more mildly. This approach is suitable for women who may prefer or require a less intensive medication regimen.

### Egg Retrieval
Both IVF and Mini-IVF include egg retrieval, but Mini-IVF aims for a smaller number of eggs. This aligns with the overall gentler approach of Mini-IVF.

### Cost
Mini-IVF is generally more cost-effective than traditional IVF due to the reduced need for expensive medications and fewer monitoring appointments. This makes it a more affordable option for many couples.

## Mini IVF Protocol

The Mini-IVF protocol involves several key steps:

- **Ovarian Stimulation**: Uses low-dose oral medications or a combination of oral medications and low-dose injectables to produce a smaller number of quality eggs.
- **Monitoring**: Regular blood tests and ultrasounds track follicle development and adjust medication dosages as needed.
- **Egg Retrieval**: A minor surgical procedure collects mature eggs from the ovaries.
- **Fertilization**: The retrieved eggs are fertilized in the laboratory with sperm using either traditional insemination or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).
- **Embryo Culture**: The embryos are cultured and monitored for several days.
- **Embryo Transfer**: High-quality embryos are selected and transferred into the uterus.

**Luteal Phase Support**: Hormonal medications, like progesterone, may be prescribed to support early pregnancy.

## Mini IVF Medications

Medications used in Mini-IVF include:

- **Clomiphene Citrate**: An oral medication that stimulates egg development by blocking estrogen receptors, leading to increased production of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).
- **Letrozole**: An oral medication that inhibits estrogen production, promoting the release of FSH and LH.
- **Low-Dose Gonadotropins**: Sometimes used in smaller doses compared to traditional IVF.

The choice of medications depends on individual needs and the recommendations of a fertility specialist.

## Success Rate of Mini IVF

Success rates for Mini-IVF vary based on factors such as patient age, health, and infertility causes. Typically, success rates range from 15% to 25% per cycle. While success rates may be slightly lower than traditional IVF due to fewer eggs being retrieved, Mini-IVF offers advantages such as reduced medication use and lower costs, which may make it a preferred choice for some individuals or couples.
