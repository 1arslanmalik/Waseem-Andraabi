This approach is preferred for its minimally invasive nature, which results in smaller incisions, reduced pain, shorter recovery times, and a lower risk of infection compared to traditional open surgery.\n\n### Laparoscopic Surgery Procedure\n\n1.**Preoperative Evaluation**: Before surgery, a thorough evaluation is conducted to assess the patient's overall health, medical history, and the specific condition being treated. This helps determine if laparoscopic surgery is appropriate.\n   \n2. **Anesthesia**: The patient is placed under general anesthesia to ensure comfort and pain relief during the procedure.\n   \n3. **Incision**: Instead of a large incision, several small incisions (0.5 to 1.5 centimeters) are made in the abdominal or pelvic area. These incisions are strategically placed to access the target area.\n   \n4. **Insertion of Trocars**: Trocar ports or cannulas are inserted through the incisions. These tubes serve as entry points for surgical instruments and the laparoscope—a thin, lighted tube with a camera.\n   \n5. **Visualization**: The laparoscope provides real-time, high-definition images of the inside of the body, visible on a monitor to guide the surgeon.\n   \n6. **Surgical Manipulation**: Tiny instruments are used to perform the necessary procedure, such as removing a gallbladder, repairing a hernia, or treating endometriosis.
