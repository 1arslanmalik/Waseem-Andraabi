This issue can be both challenging and emotionally distressing for couples trying to conceive. Understanding the signs, causes, and diagnostic tests related to male infertility is crucial for effective treatment.\n\n## Signs of Male Infertility\n\nRecognizing the signs of male infertility can help in seeking timely medical intervention. Common signs include:\n\n**Difficulty with Ejaculation**: Trouble ejaculating or a complete absence of ejaculation during intercourse may indicate issues with the sperm transport pathway.\n\n**Low Sperm Count**: A sperm count below 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen, known as oligospermia, is a common indicator of male infertility.\n\n**Abnormal Sperm Morphology**: Sperm with irregular shapes or deformities can have difficulty reaching and fertilizing an egg.\n\n**Reduced Sperm Motility**: Sperm that lack proper swimming ability may struggle to reach the egg for fertilization.\n\n**Erectile Dysfunction**: Problems with achieving or maintaining an erection can hinder the ability to engage in intercourse necessary for conception.\n\n## Causes of Male Infertility\n\nMale infertility can result from various medical and lifestyle factors. Common causes include:\n\n**Varicocele**: Enlarged veins in the testicles can lead to reduced sperm production and quality.\n\n**Hormonal Imbalances**: Issues such as low testosterone or elevated levels of certain hormones can disrupt sperm production.\n\n**Infections**: Infections in the reproductive tract, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs), can damage sperm and impact fertility.\n\n**Genetic Factors**: Genetic abnormalities, including chromosomal disorders or mutations, can affect sperm production and function.\n\n**Lifestyle Factors**: Unhealthy lifestyle choices like smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, drug use, obesity, and exposure to environmental toxins can contribute to infertility.\n \n**Age**: As with women, male fertility can decline with age, affecting sperm quality and quantity.\n\n**Chronic Illness**: Conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and certain autoimmune diseases can impact sperm production and fertility.\n";
