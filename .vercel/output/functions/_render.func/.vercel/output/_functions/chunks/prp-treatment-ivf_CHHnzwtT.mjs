PRP is a concentrated solution of platelets and growth factors derived from the patient’s own blood. Originally used in fields like orthopedics and dermatology, PRP has now been integrated into fertility treatments to enhance the success rates of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) procedures.\n\n### PRP Treatment in IVF Procedure\n\nThe PRP treatment in IVF involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Blood Sample Collection**: A small amount of the patient’s blood is drawn, typically from the arm. This sample is then prepared for PRP extraction.\n\n2. **PRP Isolation**: The blood sample undergoes centrifugation to separate red blood cells from the platelet-rich plasma. The resulting PRP is a concentrated solution rich in platelets and growth factors.\n\n3. **Preparation for IVF**: The IVF process continues as usual with ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, and sperm collection. After fertilization in the laboratory, the embryo development process begins.\n\n4. **PRP Application**: At a critical stage of embryo development, often at the blastocyst stage, a small amount of PRP is applied to the embryos. This step aims to boost the embryos' viability and implantation potential.\n\n5. **Embryo Transfer**: High-quality embryos are selected for transfer into the woman’s uterus a few days after fertilization.\n\n6. **Monitoring and Pregnancy Test**: Post-transfer, the patient is monitored for pregnancy signs. A pregnancy test is typically conducted about two weeks after the embryo transfer to assess the success of the treatment.\n\n### Success Rate of IVF with PRP in Noida\n\nIn Noida, the success rate for IVF with PRP treatment is approximately 45% to 55%. This means that around 45 to 55 out of every 100 couples undergoing IVF with PRP may achieve a successful pregnancy. These figures are indicative and can vary between clinics.\n\nFactors such as the patient’s age, underlying fertility conditions, and the expertise of the fertility clinic in Noida can influence success rates. However, the integration of PRP into IVF has shown promising improvements in pregnancy rates across many cases.\n\nFor the most accurate and personalized information, consulting with a fertility specialist in Noida is essential.\n";
