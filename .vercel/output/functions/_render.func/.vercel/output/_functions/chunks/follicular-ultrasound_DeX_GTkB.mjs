						const body = "\n**Follicular ultrasound**, also known as folliculometry, is a medical imaging technique that uses ultrasound technology to monitor the development and growth of ovarian follicles in the female reproductive system. This procedure is essential in fertility assessment and treatment, providing critical information about the maturation of eggs within the ovaries. By tracking the size and number of follicles, healthcare providers can determine the optimal timing for fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or timed intercourse.\n\n## Ultrasound Follicular Study\n\nUltrasound follicular studies are typically conducted in a single session at medical facilities and fertility clinics. The procedure involves a transvaginal ultrasound, where a small probe is inserted into the vaginal canal to obtain clear images of the pelvic organs, including the ovaries and follicles. The ultrasound technician or trained medical professional measures and monitors the ovarian follicles throughout the menstrual cycle, usually beginning in the early days and continuing until the follicles reach the appropriate size for fertility treatment.\n\n## Monitoring and Success Rates\n\nThe success of follicular ultrasound is influenced by factors such as the individual's underlying fertility issues, the accuracy of the ultrasound monitoring, and the effectiveness of the subsequent fertility treatments. While follicular ultrasound itself is a valuable tool for assessing follicle development, its success is often evaluated in conjunction with the outcomes of the fertility treatments that follow this monitoring.\n\nSuccess rates for fertility treatments following follicular ultrasound can vary based on the chosen treatment, the age and health of the patient, and other individual factors. It is important for individuals and couples seeking fertility assistance to consult with a fertility specialist who can offer personalized guidance and treatment options.\n";
