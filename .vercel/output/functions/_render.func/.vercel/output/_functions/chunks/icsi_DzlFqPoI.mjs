						const body = "\n**Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)** is a specialized form of in vitro fertilization (IVF) designed to assist couples with male infertility issues or severe sperm abnormalities. ICSI involves directly injecting a single sperm into an egg to improve fertilization chances.\n\n## ICSI Treatment Procedure\n\nThe ICSI procedure involves several key steps:\n\n- **Ovulation Stimulation**: The female partner undergoes controlled ovarian stimulation with hormones to produce multiple eggs.\n- **Egg Retrieval**: Once the eggs are mature, a minor surgical procedure called follicular aspiration is performed to extract the eggs from the ovaries.\n- **Sperm Collection**: A semen sample is collected from the male partner or a sperm donor.\n- **Microinjection**: A single sperm is selected and injected directly into the cytoplasm of each mature egg using a microscopic needle, overcoming any potential sperm-related issues.\n- **Embryo Culture**: The fertilized eggs, now embryos, are cultured in a laboratory environment for a few days to allow for development.\n- **Embryo Transfer**: The highest-quality embryos are selected and transferred into the woman’s uterus, typically 2-5 days after fertilization.\n- **Luteal Phase Support**: Hormonal medications are given to support the uterine lining and help with embryo implantation.\n- **Pregnancy Testing**: A pregnancy test is conducted approximately two weeks after the embryo transfer to assess the success of the treatment.\n\n## Success Rate of ICSI Treatment\n\nICSI generally has a high success rate compared to conventional IVF, particularly for couples dealing with male infertility issues. On average, the success rate for ICSI ranges from 40% to 60%, though this can vary based on individual factors such as the woman’s age, overall health, the quality of the eggs and sperm, and the underlying causes of infertility. It is important to note that achieving pregnancy may require multiple cycles of treatment.\n\nThe overall effectiveness of ICSI treatment depends on several variables, including the expertise of the medical team and the specific circumstances of the patients.\n";
