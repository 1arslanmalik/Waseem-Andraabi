This innovative technique offers greater control and assurance in the assisted reproductive process by identifying potential genetic issues early.\n\n### Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) Procedure\n\nThe PGT process involves several key steps:\n\n1. **In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)**: Initially, eggs are retrieved from the female partner’s ovaries and fertilized with sperm in a laboratory, resulting in multiple embryos.\n\n2. **Embryo Culture**: The embryos are cultured for several days until they reach a suitable stage for genetic testing, typically around day 5 or 6 (blastocyst stage).\n\n3. **Biopsy**: A small number of cells are carefully extracted from each embryo for analysis. This biopsy does not harm the embryo and provides genetic material for testing.\n\n4. **Genetic Testing**: The biopsy samples are analyzed for genetic mutations, chromosomal abnormalities, and sometimes the sex of the embryo. The testing aims to identify genetic disorders and ensure the embryo's health.\n\n5. **Embryo Selection**: Based on the test results, only the embryos without genetic abnormalities are selected for transfer, enhancing the likelihood of a successful pregnancy and reducing the risk of genetic disorders.\n\n6. **Embryo Transfer**: The selected embryos are transferred into the woman's uterus, where they can implant and develop into a pregnancy.\n\n### Success Rate of PGT in Noida\n\nIn Noida, the success rate of PGT is generally around 70%.
