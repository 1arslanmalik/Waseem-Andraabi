This innovative technique offers greater control and assurance in the assisted reproductive process by identifying potential genetic issues early.\n\n### Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) Procedure\n\nThe PGT process involves several key steps:\n\n1. **In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)**: Initially, eggs are retrieved from the female partner’s ovaries and fertilized with sperm in a laboratory, resulting in multiple embryos.\n\n2. **Embryo Culture**: The embryos are cultured for several days until they reach a suitable stage for genetic testing, typically around day 5 or 6 (blastocyst stage).\n\n3. **Biopsy**: A small number of cells are carefully extracted from each embryo for analysis. This biopsy does not harm the embryo and provides genetic material for testing.\n\n4. **Genetic Testing**: The biopsy samples are analyzed for genetic mutations, chromosomal abnormalities, and sometimes the sex of the embryo. The testing aims to identify genetic disorders and ensure the embryo's health.\n\n5. **Embryo Selection**: Based on the test results, only the embryos without genetic abnormalities are selected for transfer, enhancing the likelihood of a successful pregnancy and reducing the risk of genetic disorders.\n\n6. **Embryo Transfer**: The selected embryos are transferred into the woman's uterus, where they can implant and develop into a pregnancy.\n\n### Success Rate of PGT in Noida\n\nIn Noida, the success rate of PGT is generally around 70%. This means approximately 70 out of 100 couples who undergo PGT may achieve a successful pregnancy and deliver a healthy baby. Success rates can vary based on factors such as the woman's age, overall health, embryo quality, and specific genetic conditions.\n\nIt's important to consult with a fertility specialist to get a more accurate assessment based on individual circumstances and the clinic’s track record.\n\n### PGT Cost in Noida\n\nThe cost of Preimplantation Genetic Testing (PGT) in Noida varies depending on the type of testing, the fertility clinic, and additional services. On average, the cost for PGT ranges from ₹40,000 to ₹80,000 per cycle.\n\n**Cost Breakdown:**\n\n- **IVF Procedure**: ₹80,000 to ₹150,000, including ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, and embryo culture.\n- **PGT Testing**: ₹20,000 to ₹40,000 per embryo, depending on the complexity of the testing.\n- **Medications**: ₹20,000 to ₹40,000 for fertility medications.\n- **Monitoring and Consultation Fees**: ₹10,000 to ₹20,000.\n\nFor a comprehensive understanding of costs and success rates, it's advisable to consult with a qualified fertility specialist in Noida.\n";
