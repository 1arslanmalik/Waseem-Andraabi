By creating a precise opening in the zona pellucida, LAH facilitates the embryo’s ability to hatch and implant into the uterine lining.\n\n### Laser Assisted Hatching Procedure\n\nThe LAH procedure is performed at a critical stage during IVF, just before the embryo transfer. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Embryo Selection**: High-quality embryos are selected for the procedure. These embryos are cultured in an incubator and closely monitored for optimal development.\n\n2. **Laser Application**: A specialized laser, operated by skilled embryologists, is used to create a small opening or thin the zona pellucida. Precision is essential to ensure that the embryo is not damaged.\n\n3. **Embryo Transfer**: Following LAH, the embryos are transferred into the patient’s uterus. This delicate procedure requires expertise to maximize the chances of successful implantation.\n\n### Success Rate of Laser Assisted Hatching in Noida\n\nThe success rate of LAH can vary based on factors such as the patient’s age, embryo quality, and underlying fertility issues. In Noida, known for its advanced healthcare facilities, the success rate of LAH in improving implantation rates typically ranges from 60% to 70%. This reflects the positive impact of LAH on IVF outcomes in the region.\n\nIt’s important to note that success rates can differ between fertility clinics and individual patient circumstances. Consulting with a fertility specialist is essential to evaluate your specific situation and the potential benefits of Laser Assisted Hatching.\n\n### Laser Assisted Hatching Cost in Noida\n\nThe cost of Laser Assisted Hatching in Noida generally ranges from ₹20,000 to ₹30,000 per cycle. This cost is in addition to the overall expenses associated with IVF, which can vary. Factors influencing the cost of LAH include the clinic’s reputation, the experience of the medical team, and the inclusion of additional services.\n\nFor accurate pricing and a comprehensive treatment plan, consulting with fertility clinics in Noida is advisable.\n";
