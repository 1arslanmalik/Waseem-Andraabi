**What is Egg Freezing?**

Egg freezing, or oocyte cryopreservation, is a state-of-the-art procedure that allows individuals to preserve their fertility by storing eggs for future use. This technique has gained prominence due to its ability to enable women and couples to delay parenthood while protecting their reproductive options. Here’s an overview of the egg freezing procedure, its success rates in Noida, and the associated costs.

### Egg Freezing Procedure

The process of egg freezing involves several key stages:

1. **Ovarian Stimulation**: The first step involves hormone injections to stimulate the ovaries, prompting them to produce multiple eggs. This stage typically lasts 10-12 days and requires regular monitoring through blood tests and ultrasounds to track egg development.

2. **Egg Retrieval**: Once the eggs are mature, a minor surgical procedure called egg retrieval is performed. Under light anesthesia, a thin needle is inserted into the ovaries to aspirate the eggs. This procedure usually takes 20-30 minutes and is minimally invasive.

3. **Vitrification**: After retrieval, the eggs are immediately frozen using vitrification, a rapid cooling technique that prevents ice crystal formation and preserves the eggs’ quality. These frozen eggs can be stored indefinitely until needed.

### Success Rate of IVF with Egg Freezing in Noida

In Noida, the success rate of IVF with egg freezing varies based on factors such as the age of the individual at the time of egg freezing, egg quality, and the expertise of the fertility clinic. 

On average, success rates for IVF with egg freezing in Noida range from 30% to 60%. For individuals under 35 years old who freeze their eggs, the likelihood of a successful pregnancy often exceeds 50%. However, success rates generally decline with age.

Factors influencing success rates also include the reason for fertility preservation. Individuals who freeze their eggs for medical reasons, such as cancer treatment, may encounter different challenges compared to those who choose egg freezing for elective reasons.

### Egg Freezing Cost in Noida

The cost of egg freezing in Noida can vary widely depending on the clinic, the number of eggs frozen, and additional services required. On average, the cost for a single egg freezing cycle ranges from **₹1,50,000** to **₹2,50,000**.

Additional expenses may include:

- **Medications for Ovarian Stimulation**: Costs vary depending on the medication used.
- **Pre-implantation Genetic Testing (PGT)**: Optional testing can add around ₹50,000 to ₹1,00,000 to the total cost.
- **Annual Storage Fees**: Typically range from **₹10,000** to **₹20,000** per year.

It’s important to note that costs for IVF with frozen eggs, including thawing and embryo transfer, are separate. An IVF cycle, including these steps, can range from **₹1,00,000** to **₹2,50,000** in Noida.

For precise pricing and a comprehensive treatment plan, it’s advisable to consult with fertility clinics in Noida.
