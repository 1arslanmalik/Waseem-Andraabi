**Male infertility** is a condition where a man has difficulty impregnating a woman naturally. This issue can be both challenging and emotionally distressing for couples trying to conceive. Understanding the signs, causes, and diagnostic tests related to male infertility is crucial for effective treatment.

## Signs of Male Infertility

Recognizing the signs of male infertility can help in seeking timely medical intervention. Common signs include:

**Difficulty with Ejaculation**: Trouble ejaculating or a complete absence of ejaculation during intercourse may indicate issues with the sperm transport pathway.

**Low Sperm Count**: A sperm count below 15 million sperm per milliliter of semen, known as oligospermia, is a common indicator of male infertility.

**Abnormal Sperm Morphology**: Sperm with irregular shapes or deformities can have difficulty reaching and fertilizing an egg.

**Reduced Sperm Motility**: Sperm that lack proper swimming ability may struggle to reach the egg for fertilization.

**Erectile Dysfunction**: Problems with achieving or maintaining an erection can hinder the ability to engage in intercourse necessary for conception.

## Causes of Male Infertility

Male infertility can result from various medical and lifestyle factors. Common causes include:

**Varicocele**: Enlarged veins in the testicles can lead to reduced sperm production and quality.

**Hormonal Imbalances**: Issues such as low testosterone or elevated levels of certain hormones can disrupt sperm production.

**Infections**: Infections in the reproductive tract, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs), can damage sperm and impact fertility.

**Genetic Factors**: Genetic abnormalities, including chromosomal disorders or mutations, can affect sperm production and function.

**Lifestyle Factors**: Unhealthy lifestyle choices like smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, drug use, obesity, and exposure to environmental toxins can contribute to infertility.
 
**Age**: As with women, male fertility can decline with age, affecting sperm quality and quantity.

**Chronic Illness**: Conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and certain autoimmune diseases can impact sperm production and fertility.
