**What is Laparoscopic Surgery?**

Laparoscopic surgery, also known as minimally invasive or keyhole surgery, is a modern technique used to diagnose and treat various abdominal and pelvic conditions. This approach is preferred for its minimally invasive nature, which results in smaller incisions, reduced pain, shorter recovery times, and a lower risk of infection compared to traditional open surgery.

### Laparoscopic Surgery Procedure

1.**Preoperative Evaluation**: Before surgery, a thorough evaluation is conducted to assess the patient's overall health, medical history, and the specific condition being treated. This helps determine if laparoscopic surgery is appropriate.
   
2. **Anesthesia**: The patient is placed under general anesthesia to ensure comfort and pain relief during the procedure.
   
3. **Incision**: Instead of a large incision, several small incisions (0.5 to 1.5 centimeters) are made in the abdominal or pelvic area. These incisions are strategically placed to access the target area.
   
4. **Insertion of Trocars**: Trocar ports or cannulas are inserted through the incisions. These tubes serve as entry points for surgical instruments and the laparoscope—a thin, lighted tube with a camera.
   
5. **Visualization**: The laparoscope provides real-time, high-definition images of the inside of the body, visible on a monitor to guide the surgeon.
   
6. **Surgical Manipulation**: Tiny instruments are used to perform the necessary procedure, such as removing a gallbladder, repairing a hernia, or treating endometriosis. The surgeon follows the monitor to guide their actions.
   
7. **Closure**: After the procedure, instruments and trocars are removed, and the small incisions are closed with sutures or surgical glue. Minimal scarring is expected due to the small size of the incisions.
