**What is Egg Donation/Donor Eggs?**

Egg donation involves a process where a healthy woman, known as the egg donor, provides her eggs to another woman or couple facing infertility challenges. This process allows recipients to access viable eggs to conceive and carry a pregnancy to term. Donors are typically young women with healthy reproductive systems who undergo a thorough screening process to ensure their suitability.

### **Procedure of IVF with Donor Eggs**

In vitro fertilization (IVF) with donor eggs involves combining eggs from a donor with sperm from the intended father or a sperm donor. The process takes place in a laboratory, and the resulting embryos are then transferred into the recipient’s uterus or a gestational carrier. The procedure includes the following steps:

- **Donor Selection**: Careful selection of an egg donor, including evaluation of medical history, physical health, and genetic background.

- **Synchronization**: Synchronizing the menstrual cycles of the donor and recipient using hormonal medications to prepare the recipient’s uterus for embryo implantation.
- **Egg Retrieval**: Retrieving the donor’s eggs through a minimally invasive procedure called transvaginal egg retrieval, usually performed under light sedation.
- **Fertilization**: Fertilizing the collected eggs with sperm in the laboratory and monitoring the development of the resulting embryos.
- **Embryo Transfer**: Selecting the healthiest embryos and transferring them into the recipient’s uterus.
- **Monitoring and Pregnancy Test**: Monitoring the recipient for signs of pregnancy and conducting a pregnancy test to confirm the success of the procedure.

### Success Rate of IVF with Donor Eggs

The success rate of IVF with donor eggs can vary based on several factors, including the age and health of the egg donor, the recipient’s age, and the quality of the embryos. Generally, the success rates for IVF with donor eggs can exceed 60% in certain cases, making it a competitive option compared to global standards. However, individual success rates can vary, and a personalized assessment by a fertility specialist is crucial for accurate expectations.

### Cost of Donor Eggs

The cost of IVF with donor eggs can vary significantly based on factors such as the clinic’s reputation, donor compensation, medication expenses, and the number of IVF cycles required. Typically, the cost ranges from INR 150,000 to INR 300,000 or more per cycle. Additional expenses, such as pre-screening tests, embryo freezing, and post-procedure care, may not be included in this estimate.

Prospective parents should consult with fertility clinics for a detailed breakdown of expenses and explore potential financing options or insurance coverage to better manage the financial aspects of the treatment.
